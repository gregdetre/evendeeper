# TODO
#
# DBN with L layers
#
# Greedy layer-wise training
#   learn the weights for each layer l
#   pass the hidden activations as inputs to the next level
# Up-down
#   propagate the input all the way forward to level L
#   k-steps of CD in the top two layers
#   propagate back and perform positive/negative learning for each layer
#   (calculate gradient and update weights)
